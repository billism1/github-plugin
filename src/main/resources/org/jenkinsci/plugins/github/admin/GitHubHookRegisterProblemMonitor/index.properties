help.for.problems=This table shows any problems with registering/removing repo webhooks. \
  A message will be dismissed if Jenkins receives a PING event from the corresponding repo webhook, or if you add the repo to the ignore list. These messages will not be saved to disk, \

help.for.ignored=This table lists any ignored projects. Any problem with the repos in this list will be declined by administrative monitor. \
